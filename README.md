# Code Snippets Collections

This repository will be used to store one or more collections of reusable code snippets, mainly in Pascal.

## Purpose

The collections that **will be** included here are designed, by and large, for use with the _DelphiDabbler [CodeSnip](https://github.com/delphidabbler/codesnip)_ program.

Having said that, the source code in the collections can be used stand-alone<sup>&dagger;</sup>. Each collection has meta data associated with it that was originally designed for use with _CodeSnip_, but can be used with any other software designed to parse the meta data. The meta data file formats will be documented.

<sup>&dagger;</sup> Note though that some snippets depend on others. The meta data, in part, specifies those relationships.

## Collections

> Available collections will be described here.

## Development

The repo uses the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) methodology - i.e. development proceeds on the `develop` branch and `feature` branches off it. Only released content appears on the `master` branch.

## License

By default the source code contained in each collection is released under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.md) ***unless either***:

1. The directory containing the collection has its own `LICENSE.md` file - the license specified by such a file then takes precedence; ***or***

2. The snippet's source code specifies a license. In this case that license applies.
