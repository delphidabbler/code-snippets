#
#
# Two packages are made, each in a zip file: one containing the collection and
# the other containing documentation. Both zip files are written to the
# _release sub-folder in the collection's home directory.
#
# Any pre-existing _release sub-folder is cleared before the zip files are
# created.
#
# Requirements:
#
#   - The release version number must be passed to this script as a command
#     line.
#
#   - The zip utility is required to zip up the files.
