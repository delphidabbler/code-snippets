#
#
# Three packages are made, each in a zip file: one containing the
# collection, another containing documentation and a third containing tests.
# All zip files are written to the _release sub-folder in the collection's
# home directory.
#
# Any pre-existing _release sub-folder is cleared before the zip files are
# created.
#
# Requirements:
#
#   - The release version number must be passed to this script as a command
#     line parameter.
#
#   - The zip utility program is required to zip up the files.
